# Run once when the codespace is created. Does what the Binder postBuild
# does, in the codespace: installs JupyterLab and the extension from the
# same pinned requirements the Binder image uses, and writes the
# JupyterLab overrides, with two differences, both because a codespace
# belongs to the person who created it, tied to their GitHub account,
# and persists, where a Binder session is an anonymous, temporary
# container. The welcome message is the Codespaces one. And workshops
# are not forced to trusted, so the learner is shown what a workshop
# asks to do and decides before it runs anything in their codespace.
# pip rather than uv, as on Binder, since this is the learner's
# environment.
#
# The analytics setting is Binder's: it reports every session's
# progress events to the sink each collection index's analytics block
# names, without asking; the events say they came from a codespace.
# .devcontainer/welcome.md tells the learner that progress is reported.
# The second block is JupyterLab's own: it turns off the question about
# fetching Jupyter news, which would otherwise come before the welcome
# message the first time the codespace's JupyterLab opens.
#
# There is no wheelhouse, as binder/postBuild explains.

# JupyterLab for it rather than assuming the Python prefix: it moves to
# the user's home for a user-level install, which pip falls back to when
# the prefix is not writable, and to /usr/local/share for some system
# installs. sudo covers a directory this user cannot write.
